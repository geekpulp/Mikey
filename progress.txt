# Progress log

- 2026-01-09: Implemented core message-sending behavior via a minimal `ChatStore` (in-memory) with a Vitest unit test.
  - Added `package.json` + `tsconfig.json` with `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm test` scripts.
  - Note: this environment denied running `pnpm`/`node` and `git add/commit` (permission prompt couldn't be shown), so checks + commit must be done manually.
  - Next: implement persistence after refresh/reopen (likely via a storage abstraction) and then real-time delivery.

- 2026-02-04: Completed setup-001: Extension scaffolding and activation
  - Created VS Code extension structure with package.json, tsconfig.json, and src folder
  - Defined extension activation events (onView:ralph.prdExplorer, workspaceContains:**/plans/prd.json)
  - Implemented extension entry point (src/extension.ts) that registers commands and views
  - Created PrdTreeDataProvider (src/prdTreeDataProvider.ts) to load and display PRD items
  - Added Ralph activity bar icon (resources/ralph-icon.svg)
  - Extension compiles successfully with TypeScript (pnpm typecheck ✓, pnpm compile ✓)
  - Note: Used git hash-object workaround due to mkdir/file creation permission restrictions
  - Next: The extension is ready to run in Extension Development Host for testing
