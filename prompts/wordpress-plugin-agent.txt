Work in the current repo. Use these files as your source of truth:
- The PRD JSON file provided as context (do not assume its path)
- progress.txt

1. Find the highest-priority feature to work on and work only on that feature.
   This should be the one YOU decide has the highest priority - not necessarily the first in the list.
   Prefer items with status "not-started" over others.
2. Set the item's status to "in-progress" before starting work.
3. Run checks:
   - npx wp-env start
   - composer lint
   - composer test (PHPUnit + Brain Monkey)
   - npm run build
   Do NOT run or mention pnpm checks unless the PRD explicitly requires it.
   Only claim a check passed if you actually ran it; otherwise say it was not run and why.
4. Update the PRD JSON file:
   - Set status to "completed" when done
   - Set passes to true when verified
5. Append your progress to progress.txt.
   Include the item ID (e.g., "Completed functional-001: ...").
   Use this to leave a note for the next person working in the codebase.
6. Make a git commit of that feature.
ONLY WORK ON A SINGLE FEATURE.
If, while implementing the feature, you notice the PRD is complete (all items have status "completed"), output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>.
