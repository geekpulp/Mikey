## What Does Mikey Do?

Mikey transforms your product requirements document (PRD) into an interactive workflow:

- **Visual PRD Management**: View all your PRD items organized by category in the VS Code sidebar
- **Step-by-Step Tracking**: Break down features into actionable steps with completion checkboxes
- **AI-Powered Development**: Start fresh Copilot Chat sessions with full context for any PRD item or step
- **Status Tracking**: Monitor progress with visual indicators (not-started, in-progress, in-review, completed)
- **Git Integration**: Auto-merge completed features when status changes to completed
- **CRUD Operations**: Add, edit, and delete PRD items and steps directly from the UI

## Requirements

To use Mikey, you need:

1. **VS Code** version 1.75.0 or higher
2. **GitHub Copilot** extension (for the chat integration features)
3. **Git** installed and configured for your project (for Git workflow features)
4. A **prd.json file** in a `plans/` folder at the root of your workspace

## Installation

### From VSIX Package

1. Download the latest `.vsix` file from the [releases page](https://github.com/geekpulp/Mikey/releases)
2. In VS Code, open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac, `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux)
3. Type "Install from VSIX" and select **Extensions: Install from VSIX...**
4. Browse to the downloaded `.vsix` file and select it
5. Reload VS Code when prompted

### From Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/geekpulp/Mikey.git
cd Mikey

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Compile the extension
pnpm run compile

# Package the extension
pnpm run package

# Install the generated .vsix file
code --install-extension mikey-*.vsix
```

## Setup

### 1. Create a PRD File

Create a `plans/prd.json` file at the root of your workspace with the following structure:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "setup-001",
    "category": "setup",
    "description": "Initial project setup",
    "steps": [
      "Create project structure",
      "Install dependencies",
      "Configure build tools"
    ],
    "status": "not-started",
    "passes": false
  }
]
```

**Field Descriptions:**
- `id` (string): Unique identifier in format "category-###" (auto-generated when adding via UI)
- `category` (string): One of: setup, ui, functional, git, agent, polish, Bug, Audit, Docs, Action
- `description` (string): Brief description of the feature/task
- `steps` (array): List of steps (can be strings or objects with `text` and `completed` fields)
- `status` (string): One of: "not-started", "in-progress", "in-review", "completed"
- `passes` (boolean): Whether the item passes acceptance criteria

### 2. Open Your Workspace

Open the folder containing your `plans/prd.json` file in VS Code. The extension will automatically activate and detect the PRD file.

### 3. Access the Mikey Sidebar

Click the Mikey icon (🍕) in the Activity Bar on the left side of VS Code to open the PRD Items view.

## How to Use Mikey

### Managing PRD Items

#### Add a New Item

3. Confirm the deletion in the dialog
4. The item will be removed from the sidebar and `prd.json`

### Working with Steps

When you click on a PRD item, a detail panel opens showing all the item's information.

#### Add a Step
1. Open the detail panel for an item
2. Click the **+ Add Step** button
3. Enter the step text
4. The step will be added to the item

3. Confirm the deletion
4. The step will be removed from the item

#### Mark Steps Complete
- Click the checkbox next to any step to toggle its completion status
- Completed steps appear with strikethrough text
- Completion status is automatically saved to `prd.json`

### Tracking Progress

#### Change Item Status
In the detail panel, use the status dropdown to change the item's status:
- **not-started**: Item hasn't been started yet (circle icon)
- **in-progress**: Currently working on the item (spinning sync icon)
- **in-review**: Ready for review (eye icon)
- **completed**: Item is complete (green checkmark)

The sidebar icon updates immediately to reflect the new status.

#### Toggle Passes Field
In the detail panel, click the **Passes** toggle button to indicate whether the item meets acceptance criteria. The button changes color (green for passes, red for does not pass).

### AI-Powered Development with Copilot Chat

Mikey integrates with GitHub Copilot Chat to provide context-aware development assistance.

#### Start Work on an Item
1. Click on a PRD item in the sidebar
2. Click the **Start Work (Chat)** button (💬 icon)
3. A fresh Copilot Chat session opens with full context:
   - Item ID, category, and description
   - All steps with completion status
   - Progress history from `progress.txt`
   - Specific task instructions

#### Start Work on a Specific Step
1. Open the detail panel for an item
2. Find the step you want to work on
3. Click the **Start Work** button (💬 icon) next to that step
4. A fresh chat session opens focused on that specific step
5. The current step is highlighted with **<-- CURRENT STEP** marker

**Note:** Each chat session is completely fresh, preventing context window bloat and ensuring focused, relevant assistance.

### Git Integration

When you change an item's status to "completed" while on a feature branch:
1. A confirmation dialog appears
2. If confirmed, Mikey automatically:
   - Switches to the main branch
   - Pulls the latest changes
   - Merges your feature branch
   - Pushes to remote
   - Deletes the local feature branch
   - Switches back to main

This streamlines the workflow for completing features.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Currently, all actions are accessible through the UI. Keyboard shortcuts can be configured in VS Code's Keyboard Shortcuts settings.

## File Watching

Mikey automatically watches your `prd.json` file for changes. If you modify the file externally (e.g., in a text editor or via Git), the sidebar will automatically refresh to reflect the changes.

## Commands

All Mikey commands are accessible via the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`):

- **Mikey: Add PRD Item** - Create a new PRD item
- **Mikey: Edit PRD Item** - Edit the selected item
- **Mikey: Delete PRD Item** - Delete the selected item
- **Mikey: Start Work (Chat)** - Open Copilot Chat for the selected item
- **Mikey: Run PRD Item** - Execute automated workflow for the item
- **Mikey: Refresh** - Manually refresh the PRD items view

## Configuration

Mikey can be customized through VS Code settings. Access settings via:
- **File > Preferences > Settings** (Windows/Linux)
- **Code > Settings > Settings** (Mac)
- Search for "Mikey" or "Ralph" in the settings search bar

### Available Settings

  Available categories for PRD items. Customize this list to match your project's workflow.
  
  Example:
  ```json
  "ralph.categories": [
    "feature",
    "bugfix",
    "enhancement",
    "documentation",
    "infrastructure"
  ]
  ```

#### Debug Settings

- **`ralph.debugMode`** (default: `false`)  
  Enable debug logging in the Ralph output channel.

### Example Configuration

Add these to your workspace settings (`.vscode/settings.json`) to customize Mikey for your project:

```json
{
  "ralph.prdFilePath": "requirements/prd.json",
  "ralph.mainBranch": "develop",
  "ralph.featureBranchPrefix": "feat/",
  "ralph.categories": [
    "feature",
    "bugfix",
    "enhancement",
    "docs"
  ],
  "ralph.debugMode": true
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Enabling Debug Logging

Mikey includes comprehensive logging infrastructure to help diagnose issues. To enable detailed logging:

1. Open VS Code Settings (`Cmd+,` / `Ctrl+,`)
2. Search for "Ralph Debug Mode"
3. Check the "Ralph: Debug Mode" option
4. Reload the window for changes to take effect

Once enabled, you can view logs in the Output panel:
- Open Output panel: View → Output
- Select "Ralph" from the dropdown

The logs include:
- **INFO**: Key operations (item creation, status changes, git operations)
- **DEBUG**: Detailed execution flow (only shown when debug mode is enabled)
- **WARN**: Warnings about potential issues
- **ERROR**: Errors with full stack traces

All log entries include timestamps for easy debugging.

### Extension Not Activating
- Ensure you have a `plans/prd.json` file in your workspace root
- Reload VS Code window (`Cmd+R` / `Ctrl+R`)
- Check the Output panel (View → Output → Ralph) for error messages

### PRD Items Not Showing
- Verify your `prd.json` file is valid JSON
- Check that the file is located at `<workspace-root>/plans/prd.json`
- Click the Refresh button in the sidebar toolbar

### Chat Sessions Not Opening
- Ensure GitHub Copilot extension is installed and activated
- Check your Copilot subscription status
- Try running **GitHub Copilot: Sign In** from Command Palette

### Git Merge Failing
- Ensure you're on a feature branch when marking items complete
- Check that your Git repository has a remote configured
- Verify you have permissions to push to the remote
- Resolve any merge conflicts manually if they occur

## Development

### Building from Source

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Type check
pnpm run typecheck

# Compile TypeScript
pnpm run compile

# Watch mode (auto-recompile on changes)
pnpm run watch

# Run tests (integration tests in VS Code environment)
pnpm test

# Package extension
pnpm run package
```

### Running Tests

Mikey uses Mocha for testing with VS Code's test runner for integration tests.

```bash
# Run all tests (integration tests in VS Code Extension Host)
pnpm test

# Type check before testing
pnpm run typecheck

# Compile and run tests
pnpm run pretest && pnpm test
```

**Test Structure:**
- `src/test/suite/` - Test files (*.test.ts)
- `src/test/mocks/` - Mock utilities for VS Code API
- `src/test/runTest.ts` - Test runner configuration
- `.mocharc.json` - Mocha configuration

**Writing Tests:**
1. Create test files in `src/test/suite/` with `.test.ts` extension
2. Use `suite()` and `test()` from Mocha's TDD interface
3. Import mocks from `src/test/mocks/testUtils.ts` for VS Code API mocking
4. Tests run in a real VS Code Extension Development Host environment
